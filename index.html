						Hello,<br><br>My name is Joel Aaron Sandoval. I am currently a student at <a href="http://www.csumb.edu" target="_blank">California State University Monterey Bay</a>. I am studying Business Administration with a concentration in Entrepreneurship. I plan to graduate spring 2018. From there, I will be helping run my family's retail store. Simultaneously, I will be preparing for and undertake the<a href="http://www.mba.com/us" target="_blank"> Graduate Management Admissions Test</a> and/or the <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/" target="_blank"> Graduate Record Examination</a>. After a few years of gaining real-world experience, I plan on applying to a graduate program.  
						<br><br>
						My interest in business was sparked early when I discovered what franchises are. From that point, I was greatly intrigued by owning a franchise which later developed into wanting to own my own business. My hopes are to one day run the family business and use my knowledge and experience to help make it thrive.  
						<br><br>
						This website was created to help you learn more about me. Feel free to look around, read about my life, education, and professional background. You can even download my resume or add me on any of the posted social links. There is also a short survey on my contact page, so fill that out if you have a moment.

					<td><p>My name is Joel Aaron Sandoval Jr. I am the youngest of four children and I am the only boy. I have one nephew and three nieces. I enjoy many pastimes such as swimming, hiking, playing soccer, going to the beach, spending time with friends and family, eating delicious food, and trying new things. I am twenty-two years old and I am a junior in college.  Some of my favorite topics include cars and why I believe the tipping system in America is flawed. I have no pets since I’m allergic to dogs and cats and am not a big fan of animals in general. I have lived in America my entire life and have only left mainland America to visit Hawaii.  I hope to travel a lot in the future. I have many personal aspirations in my life some of them include owning my own business and designing my own house. Personally, I believe that I am a hard worker and am motivated to reach my own version of success.</p></td>
